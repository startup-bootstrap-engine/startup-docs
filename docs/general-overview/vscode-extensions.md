# VSCode Extensions

### Install Some Suggested Extensions

- **Tutorial:** Watch [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbah9ohzSI4) where I walk you through the extensions I use.
- **Extensions List:** Take a look at our suggested extensions list.
  - Make sure you have all from the required extension list; otherwise, the project won't run properly in your VSCode (missing linting, formatting issues, etc.).
